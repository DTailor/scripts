What the hell is here ?

A bunch of scripts to ease my life, and automate some tasks in order for me to enjoy a cup of tea.

1. Install zsh + [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
=

    wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/DTailor/scripts/master/zsh.sh | sh

2. Install console utils ([htop](http://htop.sourceforge.net/), [Midnight Commander](http://www.gnu.org/software/mc/) aka mc,tree(a console tree view of the current folder) )

    wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/DTailor/scripts/master/consoleApp.sh | sh
